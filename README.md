### Hey, I'm Thomaz!

Engineer, researcher, and tech enthusiast. Originally from Brazil, now at USC in LA, working on AI and leading the university's startup incubator.

I’ve been building, learning, and solving problems across different tech stacks since 13.

Most of my current work is in private repos — but feel free to explore what’s public. You can find more about my projects and journey [here](thomazbonato.vercel.app/).
